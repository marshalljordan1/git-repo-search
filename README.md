# GitHub Repositories With Search Functionality

This Coding Challenge for MVST allows you to search and filter GitHub repositories by name. It's a simple and responsive web application built using React and TypeScript, fetching data from the official GitHub API.

[Live Demo](git-repo-search-kohl.vercel.app)

## Requirements

- **React**: The application is written using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used for type checking and providing static types to your JavaScript code.
- **Git**: Version control is managed with Git, making it easier to collaborate and track changes.
- **Browser Compatibility**: The application is tested and optimized for Google Chrome.
