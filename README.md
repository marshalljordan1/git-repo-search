# GitHub Repositories With Search Functionality

This Coding Challenge for MVST allows you to search and filter GitHub repositories by name using a search bar. It's a simple and responsive web application built using React and TypeScript, fetching data from the official GitHub API.

[Live Demo](https://git-repo-search-kohl.vercel.app/)

## Requirements

- **React**: The application is written using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used for type checking and providing static types to your JavaScript code.
- **Responsive design**: This application uses Tailwind.css to ensure a responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop. 
- **Git**: Version control is managed with Git, making it easier to collaborate and track changes.
- **Browser Compatibility**: The application is tested and optimized for Google Chrome.

## Getting Started

### Extra credits

Things that are not mandatory, but we would like to see:

- +1 if you add storybook and divide the components
- +1 if you write tests
- +1 if deploy it somewhere (like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/))  
- +1 If your [code is documented](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html#jsdoc) 
- +1 If you’re up for the challenge, use the [v4 API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql), which is built using GraphQL.
- +1 If you write a README that includes
    - A short description about the project
    - Instructions on how to run it
    - Instructions on how to run the test suite
    - Future improvements

## Future Improvements
Here are some potential improvements for the project:

- Implement pagination for large search results.
- Enhance the UI with additional features like sorting and filtering.
- Provide support for more browsers.
- Allow users to search through repositories on another profile.
